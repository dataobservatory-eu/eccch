# Private Digital Infrastructure, Observatories, and a European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage

The "Report on a European collaborative cloud for cultural heritage: Ex -- ante impact assessment" doesn't mention music, only talks about recorded sound, for example, for increasing the enjoyability of immersive technologies (VR/AR/XR). The *Europeana Sounds* project ran from February 2014 to January 2017. Although Europeana Sounds, based at the British Library, continues to be an aggregator for audio and audio-related material for Europeana, a quick search for recorded music in Europeana [Music Art/activity of creating art using sound](https://www.europeana.eu/en/collections/topic/62-music?page=1&qf=TYPE%3A%22SOUND%22), brings up only 14,252 hits. For comparison, CISAC's global database holds information with pristine metadata about 52 million music works identified with the ISO 15707:2001 standard International Standard Work Code. CISAC is the world's largest network in the creative sector, with 225 societies in 116 countries. To make another comparison: 
in 2022, 213,000 artist, new creators, performers of authentic folk or classical music, and many others made *at least ten* new recordings available, resulting on a growth of more than 2 million available music recordings. More music becomes available digitally on a day than the entire body of music that can be found in Europeana.
